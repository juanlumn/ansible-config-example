# ansible-config-example
This is an example of a basic ansible configuration, to make it work:

1. Install ansible, jenkins and the plugins needed on your server machine.
2. Copy the content of this project to a folder called "ansible_config".
3. Point to the path of the files needed in the Jenkinsfile like path_to_ansible_config/yml_file.yml
